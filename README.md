# Note Taking App

A simple javascript app to add, edit and delete notes.

## How can I run this?

This was made using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/), therefore you'll need to install these programs to execute this app. Let's go step by step.

1. Go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download it. Follow the install process on your device.

2. Once you got Node.js installed, and to confirm you have installed correctly, run this command on your terminal 

    ``node --version`` and/or ``npm --version``. 

    If you get the number of the current version from your terminal, you're ready to install [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/).

3. Following the current getting started intructions posted on its own website, you'll have to run this on your terminal: ``npm install --global gulp-cli``

4. After that, go to the project folder (``cd folder-name``) and once you get there, run this command: ``npm install``. This will install all the dependecies needed (included Gulp.js) to run the app.

5. That's it! You already have all what you need to run this app and use it. Finally, run this command also in the root project folder: ``gulp`` or ``npm run gulp``.

If you find this useful, please feel free to clone or even fork this project.
